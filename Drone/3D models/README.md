This is a collection of 3D models for my drone. Files listed below as "Reference only" are modeled parts from reality (as opposed to parts I created myself).

List of parts:
- Arm.iam: a sample arm of the robot
- Battery.ipt: Reference only. The battery used for the robot
- BodyTube.ipt: Reference only. The carbon fiber tube used for the arm. Also referred to as the "Arm Tube"
- ESC.ipt: Reference only. The Electronic Speed Controller used.
- MainBody.iam: An assembly of the whole drone.
- MainDisk1.ipt: A model of the main disk. Designed to be cut out on a laser cutter. 
- MotorHolderv2.ipt: A model of the motor holder connecting the motor to the arm tube. Designed to be 3D printed in plastic.
- RodConnector-MoldVersion.ipt: A modified version of the rod connector for creating the molds. 
- RodConnector.ipt: A modle of the rod connector connecting the arm tube to the main disk. Designed to be molded in carbon fiber.

In the Motor folder:
- FullMotor.iam: Reference only. A fully assembled motor.
- FullProp.iam: Reference only. A fully assembled propeller. 
- Motor.ipt: Reference only. A model of the motor.
- MotorBasePlate.ipt: A plate I designed to make prototyping new motor holders easier. It sits between the motor and the motor connector. Designed to be cut out on a laser cutter. 
- PropConnector.ipt: Reference only. The piece used to connect the two propeller blades together and attach to the motor. 
- SingleProp.ipt: Reference only. A single propeller blade.
