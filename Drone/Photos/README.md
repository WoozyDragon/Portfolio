CentralDiskDetail.jpg shows a closer view of the central disk. Visible in the center are the control electronics. Underneath the top disk, the eight ESCs can be seen. The battery (not installed for this picture) would be mounted undernath both main disks. 

ElectronicsDetail.jpg shows the electronics. The black board to the right is the Arduino, controlling everything. The green board to the right bottom holds the IMU for measuring the drone's angle (black) and the PWM controller for controlling the power of the motors (blue). Above is the remote controller reciever.
