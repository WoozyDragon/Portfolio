A collection of the code used for my drone. 

All code is written by me, with the following exceptions:
- pwmread_rcfailsafe.ino: written by Kelvin Nelson. [Link here](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/kelvineyeone/read-pwm-decode-rc-receiver-input-and-apply-fail-safe-6b90eb)
- All libraries beginning with "Adafruit_" are provided by Adafruit. 
- The AutoPID library is written by Ryan Downing. [Link to arduino documentation here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/autopid/)
