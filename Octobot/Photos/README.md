CoreProgression.jpg is a progression of the different models of the core of the robot. Modeled by Marcus Lam, each core represents a major revision to the robot. The rightmost version is currently installed on the robot, so there isn't a good way to get a photo of it. 

RobotDriving.mp4 is a video of the robot driving around. For most of the video, it is going at the slower and more accurate speed that will be used for most of competition. It goes full speed at the end, just before it runs into the wall. All code is written by me, and I'm the one driving in this video. 

LiftRising.mp4 is a video of the lift going up. It's currently operated by me (in the blue shirt) and another team member (offscreen) because the lift motors have not yet been installed.
