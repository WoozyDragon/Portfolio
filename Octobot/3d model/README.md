A collection of 3D models for Octobot. 

All parts listed in the "Parts" folder are standard REV files, with the exception of 276-3526-004 Main Disk.ipt which is a VEX wheel. Note that only the essential component of this model was kept to reduce lag. 

The export folder contains a STEP file of the entire robot. 

A list of models:
- Basic Bracket.ipt: A custom pulley holder. Designed by another team member. 
- BracketL.ipt: A part designed to attach to the core and hold the lift motor. Designed by Marcus Lam. 
- BracketR.ipt: A mirrored version of the above.
- Core.ipt: The central part of Octobot. Everything attaches to this, from the outer ring to the drive motors to the control hub. Designed by Marcus Lam
- FullOctoMine.iam: A full 3D model of Octobot, designed by me. 
- Lift.iam: An assembly showing how the lift is put together. Designed and modeled by me using REV parts.
- Lift_MIR1.iam: A mirrored version of the lift for the full assembly.
- Motor.iam: An assembly showing how all the motors are assembled. Note the printing on the gearboxes in the model is incorrect. In reality every motor has 4:1 and a 5:1 gearbox.
