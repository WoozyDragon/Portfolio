# Portfolio

Hello and welcome!

This is a collection of my most interesting stuff, sorted by project.
More details lie in a README in important folders. 

Both projects have a 3D models folder, a code folder, and an images folder.

If you would like to check out some videos of octobot (this year's FTC robot) competing (and winning), please tkae a look at the youtube channel HotchkissRobotics, or follow this link (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlj4G4intEWXvWMBdrxXmyHjGR9i7Gdxp). 

Happy exploring!
